🚀 SPEAKO
Bridging the gap between the Deaf and Hearing worlds through AI-powered Vision and Voice.

🌟 The Problem
Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals face a massive communication barrier in everyday life. Standard voice-to-text tools often miss the environmental context (like car horns) and lack a way for Deaf users to "speak" back using their primary language: Sign Language.

✨ The Solution: SPEAKO
SPEAKO is a 2-way communication platform that acts as a digital "Sixth Sense." It uses high-speed AI to track hand gestures, monitor environmental noise, and provide a persistent history of every interaction—all within a futuristic, "Jarvis-style" HUD.

🔥 Key Features
👤 1. Secure Authentication
Gatekeeper System: Personalized Sign-In/Sign-Up to protect private communication data.

Persistent Sessions: Users stay logged in even after browser refreshes.

✋ 2. Sign-to-Voice (AI Vision)
MediaPipe Integration: Uses real-time hand-landmark tracking (21 points) to recognize Sign Language.

Neural Voice: Instantly speaks the recognized signs (e.g., Thumbs Up → "Hello") using the browser's Speech Synthesis engine.

🔊 3. Voice-to-Sign (AI Translation)
The Bridge: When a hearing person speaks, SPEAKO displays high-quality Sign Language images on the HUD.

Visual Literacy: Converts auditory signals into visual symbols for instant understanding.

💬 4. Type-to-Speak
Custom Input: A sleek text area where users can type complex thoughts and have them spoken aloud in various neon-themed voice profiles.

📜 5. Professional History Vault
Data Persistence: Every conversation is logged automatically in localStorage.

Transparency: History is stored with precise Date, Time, and Input Method (Sign or Text) for later review.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism & Keyframe Animations), Vanilla JavaScript.

AI/ML: * MediaPipe: For high-performance hand landmark detection.

Web Speech API: For real-time voice-to-text and text-to-voice.

Storage: Browser LocalStorage (No backend required for the demo—fully privacy-focused).

Design: Cyberpunk aesthetics using Google Fonts (Orbitron) and FontAwesome.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Google Chrome or Edge recommended for AI support).

A webcam and microphone.

Initialize System: Click the "Start Neural Link" button to grant camera and microphone permissions.

🎯 Our Mission
Our goal with SPEAKO is to ensure that no one is ever "silent" because of a sensory difference. We believe accessibility should not just be functional; it should be beautiful, empowering, and high-tech.
